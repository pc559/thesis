%% Abstract:
%%
\abstract{%
Numerically calculating the full primordial bispectrum predicted by a model of inflation and
comparing it to what we see in the $\cmb$ sky is very computationally intensive, necessitating layers
of approximations and limiting the models which can be constrained. The inherent separability
of the tree level in-in formalism provides a means by which to
obviate some of these difficulties.


To exploit this property, one can expand in separable basis functions.
The practicality of this method is then determined by the descriptive
power of the basis chosen, i.e.\ by the range of scenarios for which that basis provides a convergent representation
of the bispectrum. The central difficulty encountered in obtaining fast convergence is the effect of dominant non-physical
$k$-configurations. A secondary difficulty encountered is accurately including the early-time contributions
to the higher-order coefficients (which are necessary to capture feature effects, such as resonance non-Gaussianity).


In this thesis we develop this separable, template-free approach into a practical and efficient
numerical methodology which can be applied to a much wider and more complicated range of bispectrum
phenomenology than previous analyses. This is an important step forward towards observational pipelines which can
fully exploit the information contained in the primordial bispectrum to directly
confront specific models of inflation.
We use our implementation of this pipeline to obtain a constraint on $\dbi$ inflation,
and validate our implementation by comparing this constraint to an equivalent one obtained
by the $\planck$ collaboration.

I am lucky enough to be grateful to a lot of people for a lot of reasons---the lines below
will not do justice to the people mentioned, or the many people not mentioned.


First, my family, for giving me the all the opportunities I've had,
without letting me lose perspective on what's really important.
Robert, Anne, Colin, Sinéad, you've always made home feel like home,
even though I've been away for so long.
My grandparents too, for their unwavering support and inspiration
over the years.


For their patience and time, I am grateful to
Don Thornton, Dmytro Volin, and all my teachers along the way.
I am grateful to
Áron Kovács and Wuhyun Sohn, for being wonderful officemates---it's
a shame we didn't get that tally on the blackboard higher!
I would like to thank Muntazir Abidi for a warm welcome to DAMTP,
way back when I first started.
I am also immensely grateful to
my college, St.\ John's, for being so incredibly supportive and friendly.


I am grateful to
Paul Shellard, for giving me an interesting project and the freedom to pursue it.
A huge thank you needs to go to
James Fergusson, for enlightening discussions, and many helpful comments on this thesis.
And Wuhyun again---I couldn't have asked for a better colleague, collaborator or friend.


Maria Tang, and Harry Giles, for being the best pandemic tree-housemates---we made a good team!
Maeve Madigan, for uncountably many walks and lots of great advice.
Fiona McCarthy, for wonderful support, sometimes automated and always appreciated.
Your friendship while I was writing this thesis made it a lot less painful!
Everyone from badminton, or running, or the board game nights, or the shared pots of tea.
And more surprise cake than I can count!
A big thank you to the DAMTP cosmology PhD students too---for all the lunches and all the enthusiasm.


For the generosity of their financial support, I am very grateful to
the Robert Gardiner Scholarship, the Cambridge Trust European Scholarship,
St.\ John's College, and the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
I also thank the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council,
and the people of the United Kingdom.
