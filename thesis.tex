%% Abstract:

\abstract{%
Numerically calculating the full primordial bispectrum predicted by a model of inflation and
comparing it to what we see in the $\cmb$ sky is very computationally intensive, necessitating layers
of approximations and limiting the models which can be constrained. The inherent separability
of the tree level in-in formalism provides a means by which to
obviate some of these difficulties.


To exploit this property, one can expand in separable basis functions.
The practicality of this method is then determined by the descriptive
power of the basis chosen, i.e.\ by the range of scenarios for which that basis provides a convergent representation
of the bispectrum. The central difficulty encountered in obtaining fast convergence is the effect of dominant non-physical
$k$-configurations. A secondary difficulty encountered is accurately including the early-time contributions
to the higher-order coefficients (which are necessary to capture feature effects, such as resonance non-Gaussianity).


In this thesis we develop this separable, template-free approach into a practical and efficient
numerical methodology which can be applied to a much wider and more complicated range of bispectrum
phenomenology than previous analyses. This is an important step forward towards observational pipelines which can
fully exploit the information contained in the primordial bispectrum to directly
confront specific models of inflation.
We use our implementation of this pipeline to obtain a constraint on $\dbi$ inflation,
and validate our implementation by comparing this constraint to an equivalent one obtained
by the $\planck$ collaboration.
