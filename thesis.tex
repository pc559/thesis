\abstract{%
Calculating the full primordial bispectrum predicted by a model of inflation and
comparing it to what we see in the sky is very computationally intensive, necessitating layers
of approximations and limiting the models which can be constrained. The inherent separability
of the tree level in-in formalism provides a means by which to
obviate some of these difficulties.
To exploit this property, one can expand in separable basis functions.
The practicality of this method is then determined by the descriptive
power of the basis chosen, i.e.\ by the range of scenarios for which that basis provides a convergent representation
of the bispectrum. The central difficulty encountered in obtaining fast convergence is the effect of dominant non-physical
$k$-configurations. A secondary difficulty encountered is accurately including the early-time contributions
to the higher-order coefficients (which are necessary to capture feature effects, such as resonance non-Gaussianity).


In this thesis we develop this separable approach into a practical and efficient
numerical methodology which can be applied to a much wider and more complicated range of bispectrum
phenomenology than previous analyses. This is an important step forward towards observational pipelines which can directly
confront specific models of inflation.


The specific results involved can be categorised into two main lines of research.
The first line of research is in determining the feasibility of the method.
Our initial result here was identifying the contributions of the non-physical configurations
as a novel problem to this analysis, and identifying basis choice as the key method of overcoming this difficulty.
In this work we describe multiple basis sets and make quantitative comparisons
of their convergence on realistic and interesting models, including ones with features.
We find basis sets that can overcome the difficulty of the dominant non-physical $k$-configurations,
converging far more efficiently than the basic basis sets, for physically interesting models.


The second line of research we follow is in developing basis-independent methods that allow the fast and accurate calculation
of higher order coefficients of the basis expansion of the tree-level in-in formalism.
To this end we set up the separable formalism and describe the methods we use to overcome the difficulties encountered.
These difficulties include accurately including the highly oscillatory early-time contributions.
We present a careful and comprehensive validation of our methods,
showing that we can overcome the convergence problems and capture the oscillatory contributions efficiently.
At the primordial level we do this by validating our results on established templates with non-trivial
phenomenology, using the squeezed-limit consistency condition, and by comparing our
full bispectrum results to previous codes through point-tests.


TO-DO: At the level of the CMB, we validate the convergence of our basis by ensuring we can reproduce the
$\planck$ constraints on the DBI sound speed, and we translate this constraint into a constraint on
a fundamental parameter in the context of a physically realistic scan. We then go beyond this by exploring how
this constraint changes as we add features to this scenario.
