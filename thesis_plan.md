To Do
-----
- Implement more realistic DBI scenario (e.g. 0710.1812, 1103.4126, 1801.02187).
- Efficient basis choices for features (different for linear vs log osc?).
- Explore factor basis.
- $c_s^{DBI}$ constraint:
    1. Reproduce *Planck* result using decomposed template.
        1. Via CMB-BEst (coeffs sent to Wuhyun, though he is busy writing).
        2. Via James' basis (need to learn how to use James' code).
    2. Sharpen constraint with more realistic Primodal scale/shape-dependence.
        1. Via CMB-BEst (coeffs sent to Wuhyun, though he is busy writing).
        2. Via James' basis (need to learn how to use James' code).
- Find other inflation parameters to target and constrain.
- EFT time dependence?

Thesis Writing Options
--------------
1. I begin thesis writing now, but do a bit more research when Wuhyun is available again.
2. I explore efficient feature basis for $k_{ratio}=1000$ **(question - what $k_{ratio}$ is James' code implemented for?)**, do some scans, then start writing.

Thesis Outline
--------
1. **Introduction.** Given the intro of _Probing_, what else needs to be written/expanded upon for an intro? The link between primordial NG and the CMB, certainly. Also, it would be nice to make explicit the link between NG and non-linearity, possibly with some simple example. I should present a derivation of the in-in formalism, and a calculation of the interaction Hamiltonian. I could do the latter through the simpler (and more observationally relevant) form of the self-interactions, i.e. neglecting the metric perturbations. It would be nice to give a proper lit-review of the Maldacena calculation though, giving explicit mention to the field-redefinition being unnecessary. I should also present explicit details of how resonance and features generate large NG.
2. ***Probing...*** Methods and results, as in paper.
3. **Primodal Results.** What can I say purely at the primordial level? Present efficient basis sets for features, split between log and linear osc if necessary. Compare Primodal results to templates. How high can I push $p_{max}$? Discuss speed, maybe. Factor basis. Map distinguishability of templates at primordial level.
4. **Constraints.** With either CMB-BEst, or James' modes, or both.
5. **Future Work.**
6. **Conclusions.**
