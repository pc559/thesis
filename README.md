Make it functional first! Intro to the work you did, then
describe the work you did.

### Test
 - [ ] Abstract
    - [ ] Reduce to an abstract.
 - [ ] Acknowledgements
    - [ ] Write this.
 - [ ] Intro 1
    - [ ] Sort out definitions.
    - [ ] Link to figures.
    - [ ] Motivate inflation properly.
    - [ ] "We will define this properly later in sec..."
    - [ ] Move P(X,phi) later (do SR after Criteria, separate from Motivations)
    - [ ] Checking "dice". Move to Chapter 2?
    - [ ] Then $P(X,\phi)$, driving the evolution we need.
    - [ ] Unify outline.
 - [ ] Intro 2
    - [ ] Dicsussion of perturbations, how inflation seeds structure.
    - [ ] $P(X, phi)$ define perturbations, gauge etc.
    - [ ] Action.
    - [ ] Evolution, quantize, IC's, freeze-out.
    - [ ] Transfer functions for PS.
    - [ ] Define primordial bispectrum, isotropy etc.
    - [ ] Various definitions of fNL.
    - [ ] What causes a large bispectrum? When is it small?
    - [ ] Define CMB bispectrum.
    - [ ] Transfer functions, example for constant shape.
    - [ ] In-In formalism, $\dot{zeta}^3$ example.
    - [ ] How one gets the interaction Hamiltonian in general.
        - [ ] Very rough, we take this as *input*!!
    - [ ] DBI in detail.
    - [ ] Maldacena and other basic templates, move here.
    - [ ] Symmetric polynomials note.
    - [ ] Feature models.
    - [ ] F&RP.
    - [ ] Config codes.
    - [ ] Sqz limit.
    - [ ] Quote some forecasts, from Astro2020 maybe?
    - [ ] Where the error estimate comes from for CMB estimator.
    - [ ] Complexity of bispectrum estimation.
    - [ ] Modal methods.
