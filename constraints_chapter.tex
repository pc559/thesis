\section{Connecting to CMB-BEst}
    The goal here is to validate our pipeline by reproducing the $\planck$~result
    from~\cite{Planck_NG_2018}, equation (55):
    \begin{align}
        c_s^{DBI}&\ge0.079\qquad(95\%,~T~\text{only}).
    \end{align}
    We would not expect to reproduce this exactly due to
    \textcolor{red}{Lack of maps? Different approximations? Numerics?}
    Though we can estimate a reasonable disagreement by looking at
    the expected scatter between the Planck estimators, and by calculating
    \textcolor{red}{$\sigma$??}.
\section{Compare convergence at primordial level to convergence at $f_{NL}$ level}
    Comparing template decompositions to Primodal results,
    and comparing primordial convergence to CMB convergence.
    For DBI, and also for DBi resonance?
