\section{With either CMB-BEst, or James' coeffs, or both.}
\section{Compare convergence at primordial level to convergence at $f_{NL}$ level}
    \subsection{Talk about Wuhyun's work.}
\section{Validate this convergence by reproducing Planck constraint using DBI template decomp.}
\section{Then, check how the scaling from the real numerical result affects this.}
\section{EFT stuff, build off Enrico's recent work.}
