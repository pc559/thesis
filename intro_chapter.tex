    \subsection{$\Lambda CDM$.}

    \subsection{Motivate inflation.}
    \subsection{Define SR params.}
\section{Determining the weighting of a coin}
    \subsection{The PS.}
\section{Simons, Planck}
    \subsection{Descriptions}
\section{Goals}
    \subsection{connecting inflation models directly to observations, through the bispectrum ("which will be defined in section...")}
    \subsection{Constraining the parameters of inflation models, not pheno templates ($f_{NL}$ etc).}
    \subsection{Full shape information, not point samples or a limit.}
    \subsection{Efficient numerics gives access to more accurate, and in some cases new, feature shapes.}
\section{Methods}
    \subsection{building separability into the tree-level in-in formalism}
    \subsection{CMB calculation expensive, but need only be done once per primordial basis.}
    \subsection{So, want a basis expansion that converges quickly for a broad range of inflation models.}
    \subsection{Convergence on the cube is different to the tetrapyd.}
    \subsection{Turns out to be much faster at primordial level than previous numerical methods.}
\section{Results}
    \subsection{First development/implementation of the formalism for high orders, features.}
    \subsection{Pointed out the central issue of the cube vs tetra problem.}
    \subsection{Found a basis with broad descriptive power.}
    \subsection{Validated these methods on interesting examples.}
    \subsection{Explore and characterise DBI reso model TBC?? Validity of approximations, eg Tanh kink.}
    \subsection{Connect to CMB, get constraints TBC??}
